        <h5>How to run your weekly exercises</h5><br>
        <p>Every exercise will begin with a short problem statement, saying what kind of a problem you are solving.
        At the end you'll also see an example of the input data and the output that your program shoud produce.
        Your program must be written inside a function, whose name and arguments will be given to you with every exercise.
        The program should return the desired result. Any output that will be printed on the terminal will not be
        checked by the code checker. This means you can use <code>print()</code> for helping you find errors in your code.
        You can run your code independetly, without it being tested, just by typing <code>python name_exercise.py</code>.
        The python file that has been provided for you is used to test what you have written with some additional test cases.
        Make sure your program and the test program are in the same folder and that their names follow this structure:
        <code>name_exercise.py</code> for your program and <code>name_tester.py</code> for the test program.
        After you run the tester you will recieve a feedback telling you how your code has performed.
        The tester can be run as many times as possible
        The exercise is finised when you get a 100 % score.
        Keep in mind that there might be some edge cases in the tests.
        <br>
        <h5>Example 1<br></h5>
        Write a function named <code>example1()</code> that returns a <samp>"Hello world!"</samp> string.
        This exercise is already finised and you just have to run the code
        <br><pre><code>
        def example1():<br>
            return "Hello world!"</code></pre>
        <br>
        <h5>Example 2<br></h5>
        Write a function called <code>sum(a, b)</code> that takes in two aguements and returns their sum
        <br><pre><code>
        def sum(a, b):<br>
            return a + b</pre></code>
        <br>
        This is the form in which you should be writing your programs.
        <br>
        If you want to test your code with your own parameters you'll have to call the function and
        pass in the correct arguments. For example:
        <br><pre><code>
        c = sum(2, 3)<br>
        print(c)<br></pre></code>
        </p>
